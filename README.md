# Lemonbar library for Rust

Use [lemonbar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar)? Like Rust? This is the library for you! Write your blocks in Rust and output them to lemonbar with these simple structs.

## Current features
* Blocks to hold your info
* Left/center/right alignment
* Buttons for mouse actions
* A Bar to keep it all together

## Roadmap

* Font changing (`%{Tn}`)
* Under/overline
* Color swap (`%{R}`)?
* Multiple monitor support
* Ability to launch lemonbar with options instead of just generating text?
